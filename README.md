# Enhanced-Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm-with-Multi-Qubit-Balanced-Functions
The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can efficiently determine whether a function is constant (same output for all inputs) or balanced (outputs 0 for half of the inputs and 1 for the other half). In classical computing, this determination requires multiple evaluations, but quantum computing can do it in a single run. We'll create the Deutsch-Jozsa circuit to evaluate multi-qubit functions.
